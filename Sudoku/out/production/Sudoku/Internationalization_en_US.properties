instructions= The classic sudoku consists of one big 9x9 block, that is filled with 9 \
\n smaller 3x3 blocks and each small block has 9 boxes. The rules are simple:\
\n 1) every row has to have exactly 1 number from 1 to 9\
\n 2) every column has to have exactly 1 number from 1 to 9\
\n 3) every small 3x3 block has to have 1 number from 1 to 9\
\n The purpose of the game is to fill all the boxes following the rules.\
\n At the start of the game some boxes will already be filled with a number that will make the solution of the puzzle unique.\
\n The game supports,except from the classic mode, 2 different versions called Killer sudoku and sudoku.DuidokuMode.\
\n Killer sudoku follows the same rules of the classic mode with one extra rule:\
\n Every box is a part of a pack of boxes and every pack has the attribute that the sum of all the numbers in the boxes of the pack must be equal to a specific number that is shown\
\n from the beginning. To distinguish the packs between them, every pack has its boxes colored and the sum is shown in the upper left corner of the first box of the pack.\
\n Another difference is that when the game starts, no numbers are given to help you.\
\n sudoku.DuidokuMode is a mode that needs two players. It starts with an empty 4x4 block with 4 smaller 2x2 blocks and the players have to fill it following the rules of the classic mode by playing one after the other\
\n Because of how it is, after some turns, some blocks may not be filled with any number, so they will remain empty  until the end of the game. The game is finished when there are not any legal moves and the winner is the one that made \
\n the last move. On this application, the second player is the pc and the player always makes the first move.\
\n How to play:\
\n At the start of the app, you are shown 6 options:\
\n Classic \
\n Killer sudoku\
\n Play sudoku.DuidokuMode\
\n Login\
\n Check Stats\
\n Quit\
\n The first three options will launch a game, depending on the mode that you have chosen. Before the game starts, it will ask you if you want to play Wordoku. Wordoku is the same thing as sudoku, \
\n with its only difference being that instead of numbers, every box must be filled with letters, specifically A-I for the first two modes and A-D for sudoku.DuidokuMode. After you choose whether you want to play\
\n wordoku or not, another window will open with the board of the game. After it launches, you can try to solve the puzzle by left-clicking on a box and pressing the number or\
\n letter you want it to be filled. If the move follows the rules, then it will be entered. If not, then the game will show you a message saying that this move isn't allowed because it broke one or some of the rules\
\n It will also tell you which rule the move would break. Every time you left-click on a box, the previous insertion will be deleted, so be careful where you click! On the bottom left corner there is a green button\
\n with a check on it. Whenever you click it, it will tell you if you have completed the puzzle or not. If the puzzle is solved, then it will show you a message and will then close the window of the solved board.\
\n The game also supports hints for the boxes. When your mouse is hovering above one box and then you right-click on it, a message will be shown to you with all the possible legal moves you can make. In the killer mode, the hint\
\n will show you the sum of the color block. In the classic mode, the boxes \
\n that are loaded from the start of the game are uneditable, so the player cannot change them. This also happens when you or the pc makes a move in the sudoku.DuidokuMode mode. After a move, the box cannot be changed.\
\n The game also supports the insertion of a nickname, so a player can save their stats. By pressing the login button on the main menu, you are asked to enter your username. After you type it and press enter,\
\n you will be logged in as your nickname. If you have played before, it will store your statistics, them being how many classics you've won, how many killers you've won and your sudoku.DuidokuMode wins/loses. We encourage the player to log in\
\n because we can make sure that you won't play a puzzle that you've already won, unless you've played them all!\
\n When you're logged in, you can see your stats by pressing the button "show stats" in the main menu. You can change the nickname and log in as another player anytime you want. You can play anonymous if you want to, though.\
\n Finally,there is an "Exit" button that does as it says, it first asks you to confirm you want to close the game, and if it gets your approve, it will close the game.
